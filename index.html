each critical asset. Mr. Doucett also in partnership with the City of Cambridge
Community Development Department and City of Cambridge Department of Public
Works, developed the FloodViewer web app, which allows stakeholders to dynamically
view the most up-to- date flooding information citywide, as well as at an individual parcel
resolution.</p>

<br />

Mr. Doucett is the GIS specialist for the ongoing IDDE and water quality analysis project
for the BWSC. The RCC and DBC are tidally influenced pipelines that directly discharge
into the Fort Point Channel where dry-weather water quality issues have been observed.
There are limited access points along these pipeline alignments as they traverse along
cross-country easements, private properties and highway and rail corridors.

<br />

Mr. Doucett is responsible for developing and maintaining accurate maps of the RCC and
DBC as well as other critical infrastructure within and around the project area. He has
also assisted with developing manhole inspection, building inspection, and water quality
sampling maps where the data collection is done using ESRI ArcGIS Online software and
field inspection tablet technology.</p>
